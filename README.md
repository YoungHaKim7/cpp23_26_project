Despite the pandemic the C++ committee is continuing to work towards C++23. This survey presentation provides students with a broad overview of the changes and new facilities in the C++23 standard library.

# C/C++ Support in Clang[|üîù|](#link)

- Clang implements the following published and upcoming ISO C++ standards:
  - https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html

|Language Standard |	Flag |	Available in Clang? |
|-|-|-|
|[C++2c](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx26)<br> C++26|	-std=c++2c | Partial|
|C++23|	-std=c++23 <br> -std=c++2b |	Partial|

# GCC / Clang[[üîù]](#link)
```-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic``` 
- use these and consider the following (see descriptions below)

## see descriptions below

- `-lm` - ÌïÑÏöîÌïòÎã§Î©¥ ÌëúÏ§Ä ÏàòÌïô Ìï®ÏàòÎ•º Ï∂îÍ∞ÄÌïúÎã§. 

- ```-pedantic``` - Warn on language extensions

- ```-Wall -Wextra``` reasonable and standard

- ```-Wshadow``` warn the user if a variable declaration shadows one from a parent context

- ```-Wnon-virtual-dtor``` warn the user if a class with virtual functions has a non-virtual destructor. This helps catch hard to track down memory errors

- ```-Wold-style-cast``` warn for c-style casts

- ```-Wcast-align``` warn for potential performance problem casts
-Wunused warn on anything being unused

- ```-Woverloaded-virtual``` warn if you overload (not override) a virtual function

- ```-Wpedantic``` (all versions of GCC, Clang >= 3.2) warn if non-standard C++ is used

- ```-Wconversion``` warn on type conversions that may lose data

- ```-Wsign-conversion``` (Clang all versions, GCC >= 4.3) warn on sign conversions

- ```-Wmisleading-indentation``` (only in GCC >= 6.0) warn if indentation implies blocks where blocks do not exist

- ```-Wduplicated-cond``` (only in GCC >= 6.0) warn if if / else chain has duplicated conditions

- ```-Wduplicated-branches``` (only in GCC >= 7.0) warn if if / else branches have duplicated code

- ```-Wlogical-op``` (only in GCC) warn about logical operations being used where bitwise were probably wanted

- ```-Wnull-dereference``` (only in GCC >= 6.0) warn if a null dereference is detected

- ```-Wuseless-cast``` (only in GCC >= 4.8) warn if you perform a cast to the same type

- ```-Wdouble-promotion``` (GCC >= 4.6, Clang >= 3.8) warn if float is implicitly promoted to double

- ```-Wformat=2``` warn on security issues around functions that format output (i.e., printf)

- ```-Wlifetime``` (only special branch of Clang currently) shows object lifetime issues

- ```-Wimplicit-fallthrough``` Warns when case statements fall-through. (Included with -Wextra in GCC, not in clang)

Consider using ```-Weverything``` and disabling the few warnings you need to on Clang

- ```-Weffc++``` warning mode can be too noisy, but if it works for your project, use it also.
